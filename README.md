# animationsWithTurtle
FAMOUS LOGOs x SHAPEs x DESIGNs made with the turtle library in Python 3.6.4
None of these designs/shapes/logos are mine except for the files that are labelled mattdesignxx. All the other animations drawn with the turtle library were inspired by the search results on google images.
